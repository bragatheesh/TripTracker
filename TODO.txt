TODO: 
design a way to figure out if the car has been started
	maybe poll rpm?
	could be an ignition status we could read

implement logic for polling vehicle speed for some resolution

implement connection to a home server upon car shutting off, if no connection present, add current trip to queue and push when connected to home wifi

implement the home server (huge task, will break down later)
	recv data from pi and aggregate, run analytics, display graphically

build connection infrastructure for bluetooh connectivity (will probably go down this route later on as wifi might prove to be unreliable)
